 <h2 id="h2">Our Purpose</h2>
  <h3 id="h3">Mission Statement</h3>
    <br>
    <p id="p1"> Selcouth prides itself on delivering a professional, accessible and trustworthy service for those wanting to start a family with the help of ground-breaking scientific research. We aim to encourage families to believe and trust in our service in aiding in their IVF treatments to help begin their future families. A genome mapping experiment was done prior to launching Selcouth that allowed our scientists to distinguish what genetic markers such as hair and eye colour, that could be chosen in the selection process of 'creating' your IVF child. At Selcouth, we are a welcoming and friendly family that would love the honour of following you along your IVF journey with us. </p>

    <h3 id="h3">What We Do</h3>
    <br>
    <p id="p1">Selcouth is the future of IVF. We are a company that allows its users/client to ultimately 'create' their idea of a perfect child through physical characteristics and sexuality. Our users will supply us with information about themselves and then will go through a screening process to ensure that they can afford the service and would make fit parents, as well as being strong advocates for Selcouth. Then they are able to decide which physical characteristics they would like to apply to their embryo but at a cost. The rarer the characteristic, the more expensive. This allows for uniqueness within each Selcouth child and gives us a better understanding on what people are finding physically attractive, allowing us to use that information to help us grow as a company. After our clients have filled out the creation form, they will be sent a confirmation email with all of the details and options they've selected and further instructions will be given. They will have to be impregnated in one of Selcouth's fertility clinics that are scattered around the world. We know that this process can be emotional and a difficult one, so we want all of our users/clients to feel free to contact us at any time with any concerns or questions you may have.</p>
